I am a fifth year Mechatronics Engineering and German Language and Culture student currently working as a software engineer for Evie Networks in the electric vehicle charging infrastructure space.

I am excited by Australiaâ€™s transition to electric vehicles and green power. I believe that as a Mechatronics Engineer I will be well placed to develop technologies that capitalise on this opportunity.
