Each week at work, one person or team will give a presentation to the rest of the workplace with the goal of knowledge sharing and education. One week, one team member gave a presentation on a recent business trip to Europe where they engaged with other electric vehicle charging companies. This presentation focused on three delivery companies and how policies in Europe had encouraged a quicker adoption of Electric vehicles then otherwise would have been feasible.

As part of this presentation, we saw statistics about how Australia compares to other countries when it comes to electric vehicle adoption and renewable energy. On the international stage, in comparison to other developed nations, Australia is being outperformed and has some of the least ambitious targets. Upon hearing this I felt disappointed. Although not particularly patriotic, I believe that if Australia was leading the world in something as important as emissions standards I would feel proud.

As we are trailing other countries, our presenter pointed out that there is a lot we can learn from the leading countries to speed up our own uptake. It also helped me realise that while I felt disappointed and a lack of pride – this shouldn’t be a competition. The disappointment was not at Australia’s lack of action, it was that other countries were doing more. It was almost jealousy. I realised that Australia has a global responsibility to reduce emissions and look for greener alternatives, and if other countries have already tried things, then we should work with them wherever possible to speed up the process for everyone.

I came to believe that for certain things, knowledge sharing is critical. Especially in the global context between countries which might be less or more developed than one another.
