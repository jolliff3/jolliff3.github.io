About halfway through my internship, I was tasked with exploring ways that the company could minimise their energy costs while continuing to meet sustainability requirements. As the company I work for primarily sells energy to electric vehicle drivers, I realised this would have a large impact on the company’s overall profitability. I was excited to undertake such a big and important task. The specific task I was given was open-ended: “minimise cost of goods without breaking our sustainability contracts”. As I started to investigate the sustainability contracts, I began to realise that this was a complex field. I didn’t expect much of my time to be taken up by trying to understand the contract, but I soon realised that this was in fact most of the task.

After spending a lot of time reading about renewable energy generation certificates and government rebate schemes, I believed that the best approach to achieve my designated task was to work around the government requirements through loopholes in the schemes. As I continued to think about this, I began to feel uncomfortable with this idea. From a gross margin standpoint, it makes sense to only do the bare minimum required under a contract. However, from an environmental and sustainability perspective this was avoiding responsibility.

I spoke with my supervisor about the various ideas I had, as well as my concerns. I found our discussion to be helpful and he echoed my concerns that as a business we shouldn’t be striving to do the bare minimum, but he encouraged me to continue exploring the green energy certificates and the policy surrounding them to better understand them.

In Engineers Australia sustainability policy (Sustainability Policy, 2014), one of the ways members must promote sustainable practices is through understanding: “[members must] maintain an up-to-date knowledge and understanding of sustainability principles, and practices relevant to their area of practice”.
