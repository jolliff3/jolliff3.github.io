As the company I work for primarily sells energy to electric vehicle drivers, I realised this would have a large impact on the company’s overall profitability. I was excited to undertake such a big and important task. The specific task I was given was open-ended: “minimise cost of goods without breaking our sustainability contracts”. As I started to investigate the sustainability contracts, I began to realise that this was a complex field. I didn’t expect much of my time to be taken up by trying to understand the contract, but I soon realised that this was in fact most of the task.</p><p>After spending a lot of time reading about renewable energy generation certificates and government rebate schemes, I believed that the best approach to achieve my designated task was to work around the government requirements through loopholes in the schemes. As I continued to think about this, I began to feel uncomfortable with this idea. From a gross margin standpoint, it makes sense to only do the bare minimum required under a contract. However, from an environmental and sustainability perspective this was avoiding responsibility.</p><p>I spoke with my supervisor about the various ideas I had, as well as my concerns. I found our discussion to be helpful and he echoed my concerns that as a business we shouldn’t be striving to do the bare minimum, but he encouraged me to continue exploring the green energy certificates and the policy surrounding them to better understand them.</p><p>In Engineers Australia sustainability policy (Sustainability Policy, 2014), one of the ways members must promote sustainable practices is through understanding: “[members must] maintain an up-to-date knowledge and understanding of sustainability principles, and practices relevant to their area of practice”.
